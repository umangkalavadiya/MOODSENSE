The problem with delivering a lesson as a university professor is that you never truly know the real or close to real insight emotions or feedback which can be derived from those emotions about how the student feels about a particular professor teaching style or delivered lessons. There is often stigma among college
students to not participate in evaluating these teaching related problems accurately also the threat of one or
two biased experiences driving towards the false results could be a problem too. Furthermore, to evaluate
and know the feedback of students is an essential brick in the wall of education industry thus Moodsense
helps with collecting real time data and draw insights from it.
